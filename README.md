# FrontendKanban

This is the Frontend part of Kanban, the whole service is already deployed to AWS. You could access the service
by visiting the website: http://54.242.195.155:8080/.

To install and test it on local machine, you need to have vue 3.0 and javascript environment. Also, you need to install
vue-custom-scrollbar installed. Then, you could use vue ui, and run the frontend service. Frontend part should be set and
started after the backend part being set.
